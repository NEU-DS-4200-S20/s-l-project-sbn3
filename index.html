    <h1>Project Team SBN3: Directory Data, DS 4200 S20</h1>

    <p><strong>Carson Cook</strong>, <strong>Divit Koradia</strong>, <strong>Prisca Joseph</strong>, <strong>Ruisong Wang </strong></p>

    <p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1781714">DS 4200: Information Presentation and Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~dcashm01/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://visualization.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Data Visualization @ Khoury</a>, <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>.</p>


    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p>SBN was founded in 1988 as the nationâ€™s first business trade association with a mission of making business a vehicle for social, environmental, and economic change. They envision a resilient world economy composed of thousands of inter-connected local economies that benefit the lives of all people and all living things. SBN endeavors to build a successful model in Massachusetts and New England that inspires others to join with SBN in growing the sustainable economy movement.</p>

    <p>Our goal is to showcase the local communities of New England and the various businesses that contribute to SBN goals so that people can learn more about these organizations and hopefully support them. We thought it would be helpful to represent the strength of SBN's community on a map so that users can understand the scale of this organization and also quickly refer to a business in their vicinity that has been working with SBN</p>

    <p>The visualization we created allows a user to explore all the organizations working with SBN by zooming in and out of the map or by clicking on the table below to find further information about a business. </p>

    <h1>Visualization</h1>

    <p>Each dot on the map represents one of the many businesses working with SBN. The table next to the map has important information regarding these businesses.</p>
    

    <p> You can interact with the visualization in the following ways:    </p>
      <li>Select one or many businesses in the table below and the map will reflect their location by highlighting the specific businesses in red color.</li>
      <li>Select one or many businesses in the map below and the table will reflect their information by highlighting the specific businesses in red color.</li>
      <li>Click on a state to zoom in for a better view of the organizations that are working with SBN.</li>

  <h1>Demo Video</h1>

  <p> Embedded MP4 demo video using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag. For example, this screen recording Prof. Cody Dunne made of Mike Bostock's flexible transitions in D3 slide:  </p>

      <p> Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.  </p>

      <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
      <p><b>Summary of data</b></p>
      <p> The data given to us by SBN gives an overview of the members in the network including some basic information about each member. There are columns for the member type, name of the business or organization, product/service type, address information, phone number and email. The majority of the data given was categorical.   </p>
      <p><b>Data Preprocessing</b></p>
      <p> 
        We found that several of the columns lacked information. Specifically, the address column was missing data for nearly 30 organizations. We were able to fill in most of the missing data simply by searching for the information on Google. However, some organizations still had missing addresses and we assume that is because they lack a physical (brick and mortar) presence.
        </p>
      <p> Lastly, we had to find the latitude and longitude for all the organizations in our dataset to plot it on the map. We used a google script that consist of a simple function which returns the latitude and longitude values for given address using the Google Maps Geocoder.  </p>
      <p> After we finalized our dataset, we started working on creating our visualization!  </p>

      <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

      <p> There are various business in the local community of New England. SBN is willing to build up a strong connection among them to facilitate their collaboration and establish conducive business environments. Our domain task is to showcase the organizations to everyone who will use our visualization.  </p>

      <p> We intend to help users to gain awareness of the location, business and contact information by utilizing interactive map and table. Users are allowed to zoom in and out and gather any further information they want by playing with the visualization.  </p>

      <p> Our visualization aims to 'present' and make a 'summary/overview' about the local business in the community of New England. Users can 'explore' information they want from our visualization.  </p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>

      <p> We designed our visualization iteratively through first finding examples, then making a sketch, and finally creating a mockup in Tableau.  </p>
      <p> Our first step designing our visualizations was to take inspiration from visualizations that have already been made for similar functions. To do this, we all set out to find a visualization that related to the tasks we were trying to complete. We wanted to see different layouts, features, and general ideas that we could mold into our own.  </p>
      <p> Next, we sketched out a few ideas we had for visualizations. These sketches were, for the most part, directly inspired by the working examples. The goal was to place different elements and see how they looked before actually coding anything. This way, we could move into making an interactive version efficiently.  </p>
      <p> Finally, we created a working mockup in Tableau. This was very easy, and we were able to connect our data to show both a map of the member locations, as well as have a filterable table on the side. These are elements that are more difficult to do in D3, so Tableau was very useful in that aspect. Through making these interactive visualizations, we were able to see what worked with our ideas and what did not.
